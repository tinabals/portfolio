title: Building my Portfolio
description: Every developer needs a portfolio, well literally everyone needs one, I have design up to 3 portfolio over the years finally settling on this one. Funny, in a short while this portfolio has undergone a lot of changes, but I am still proud of it. Started with Next.js then migrated to Nuxt.js it's a fun ride through the developement (still building btw ðŸ”Ž).
